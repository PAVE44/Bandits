description=This mod introduces a new repeating game event that spawns hostile enemy NPC bandits that will chase players. [b]Works in multiplayer![/b]
description=
description=Please be aware that armed enemies are extremely dangerous and challenging. You might need to unlearn some of the things you learned fighting zombies.
description=
description=This mod is highly experimental and in beta testing. Please do not use it with valuable game saves, or make backups first. Please report bugs (other than tbose listed below) and leave feedback and ideas in the comments.

description=[h2] Auto-Spawn Wave System[/h2]
description=After new player is created, you have 1-2 days to prepare. After that time, small groups armed with melee weapons will come to hunt you. Over time, larger groups armed with pistols and rifles are to be expected. If you die and create a new character, that process repeats. In multiplayer, this happens independently for each player, so that some players have weaker groups attacking them, and some stronger.
description=
description=When the event(wave) occurs, the attacked player will see a marker at the top of the screen. It will indicate bandit spawn point, not their actual position. Marker will not disappear automatically, but double clicking it will make it go away. Enemies will spawn about 40 squares from the player in random direction.
description=
description=If you want to change anything related to auto-spawning, check sandbox options. You have 16 separate schedules that controls each of the waves. Each schedule controls the start and the end days between which this wave may be spawned, the chance that the spawn will happen, number of spawned bandits, their look, weapons etc.
description=
description=It is possible to enable friendly waves. Friendly bandits will assist player and follow him and help him to fight zombies and other bandits.
description=
description=If you want to test this mod and spawn waves by hand, start the game in debug mode and use context menu.

description=[h2] Auto-Spawn Defender Bandits [/h2]
description=
description=Some of the bandits will not chase player. Instead, they will spawn in buildings and protect them. Players will find different bandits, depending on the building type. This type of bandits are always hostile.

description=[h2]Bandits FAQ[/h2]
description=Hostile bandits priority is always to find you and kill you. If they are they encounter other zombies they will only kill them if they are an obstacle to pursuing you.
description=
description=Bandits carrying ranged weapons have limited ammo. If you kill them you can look their weapons with the remaining ammo.
description=
description=Bandits rifle range is always 24 square, and pistol range is 10. This is shorter than players' range. Use it to your advantage. Bandit shooting reflex is random. Bandit accuracy is lower on the larger distance.
description=
description=Bandits will smash windows, open doors and, if they are locked, they will slowly start destroying it. Barricaded windows will not be destroyed.

description=[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
description=This mod is developed in clean vanilla environment. This does not mean it won't work with other mods, it means I don't test it and you have to find out yourself for now. It is very hard to predict interactions with so many mods around. However I want this mod to work with the most popular, natural mods in the end, so I will direct some efforts to do so.
description=
description=This mod does not rely on in-game npc code or other mods that rely on it. This is because that code does not work I  multiplayer and I really wanted this to work online.

description=[h1]Roadmap[/h1]
description=
description=The main idea will be to introduce different behavior programs for bandits. Apart from currently working attacking bandits, there will be defending bandits, for example the remnants of the army guarding the last outposts, survivors in the barricaded houses, guerrilla on the bridges. The world in its last days will be challenging and brutal. There will be random events that will surprise and scare you to death, no spoiler examples here.
